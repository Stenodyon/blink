# Blink

Blink is a game prototype I am developing [on
stream](https://www.twitch.tv/stenodyon). It is a puzzle game involving lasers
and mirrors, and is heavily inspired by
[OCTOPTICOM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/943190/OCTOPTICOM/).

## Building

Blink uses makefiles to build. (Hopefully I will be able to move the the
zig build system).

Dependencies:

* `zig 0.4.0`
* `SDL2`
